NAME
    DBIx::Inline - DBIx::Class without the class.

DESCRIPTION
    An "inline" version to DBIx::Class, but by no means an alternative or
    its equal in any sense. Due to boredom and too many classes lying around
    I put together DBIx::Inline to try and emulute some of DBIx::Class' cool
    features into one script. It's far from it, but I believe it's an OK
    work in progress. You can still create accessors, but they are done on
    the fly using DBIx::Inline::ResultSet->method(name => sub { ... }).
    Results have ->method, but the easiest way is to use
    $row->load_accessors, which will create methods for all of your result
    values (DBIx::Inline::Result) Check out the synopsis for more info on
    how to use DBIx::Inline.

SYNOPSIS
        package main;

        use base 'DBIx::Inline';

        my $schema = main->connect(
            dbi => 'SQLite:test.db'
        );

        my $rs = $schema->resultset('my_user_table');
    
        # create an accessor
        $rs->method(not_active => sub {
            return shift->search([], { account_status => 'disabled' }, { order => ['id'], limit => 5 });
        });

        # chain the custom resultset method with a core one (count)
        print "Rows returned: " . $rs->not_active->count . "\n";

        # make the records in the resultset active
        # will return a resultset with the updated data
        my $new_rs = $rs->update({account_status => 'active'});

  connect
    Creates the Schema instance using the hash specified. Currently only dbi
    is mandatory, which tells DBI which engine to use (SQLite, Pg, etc). If
    you're using SQLite there is no need to set user or pass.

        my $dbh = DBIx::Inline->connect(
            dbi => 'SQLite:/var/db/test.db',
        );

        my $dbh = DBIx::Inline->connect(
            dbi  => 'Pg:host=myhost;dbname=dbname',
            user => 'username',
            pass => 'password',
        );

  model
    This method needs a lot of work, but it functions at the moment. And I
    like it. Instead of calling the connect method in every file, you can
    share the model by putting it in inline.yml, like so.

        # inline.yml
        ---
        Foo:
          connect: 'SQLite:foo.db'
    
        AnotherSchema:
          connect: 'Pg:host=localhost;dbname=foo'
          user: 'myuser'
          pass: 'pass'

        # test.pl
        package main;
  
        my $rs = main->model('AnotherSchema')->resultset('the_table');
