            Added the 'search_join' resultset method. Check out L<DBIx::Inline::ResultSet> for more information

            Sorry about the major change, but the Schema method 'resultset' has been changed to 'table'.
            I do apologize, but I couldn't live with it anymore.. it was a TABLE not a ResultSet.. argh.

            Added sqlite method to main class. Now you can open a SQLite file 
            without having to go through a model or dbi strings.
