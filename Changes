            Made some changes to the documentation.

0.16        02/Dec/2011
            Added 'related' option to config file.

            Altered 'model' to let you add a resultset to the models file. Just use 'resultset: YourTableName' and it will automatically load it for you.
            This will also be in the documentation, too.

            Hopefully fixed broken test. Changed the test module to Test::Lite.
            I honestly hope this doesn't screw anyone over, but table is now, again, resultset (Won't happen again. Promise).

            Added the 'search_join' resultset method. Check out L<DBIx::Inline::ResultSet> for more information

            Sorry about the major change, but the Schema method 'resultset' has been changed to 'table'.
            I do apologize, but I couldn't live with it anymore.. it was a TABLE not a ResultSet.. argh.

            Added sqlite method to main class. Now you can open a SQLite file 
            without having to go through a model or dbi strings.
